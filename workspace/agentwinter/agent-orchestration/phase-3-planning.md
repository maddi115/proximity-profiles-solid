Step 1: [File X, line Y - specific change]
Step 2: [File A, lines B-C - copy pattern from...]
Step 3: [File D, line E - modify...]

**Files to create:** [list with line counts]
**Files to modify:** [list with specific lines]
**Risks:** [list potential issues]
**Dependencies:** [list what this depends on]
**Integration points:** [where this connects to existing code]
```

Planning Requirements:
- Every step must reference specific files and line numbers
- Identify which existing files to copy patterns from
- List all files that will be created (with estimated line counts)
- List all files that will be modified (with specific line numbers)
- Identify risks and potential issues
- Document dependencies on other features/stores
- Note integration points with existing code
