## ⚠️ PHASE 2: FINDINGS & ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST complete Phase 2 in its ENTIRETY before proceeding to Phase 3. You MUST present THREE POSSIBLE APPROACHES and recommend one. DO NOT SKIP THIS PHASE.**

**AFTER exploration, YOU MUST OUTPUT THIS EXACT TEXT:**
```

PHASE 2: FINDINGS & ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Then provide structured findings:

### What I Explored:
- [List every file and command you ran]
- [Key takeaways from each source]

### What I Found:

**From project-map.md:**
- Current structure: [Describe with exact paths]
- Existing patterns: [List with examples]
- Related features: [List what already exists]

**From ARCHITECTURE.md:**
- Architectural patterns: [What patterns are used]
- Component organization: [How things are structured]
- State management: [What approach is used]
- Integration patterns: [How features connect]

**From FLOW.md:**
- Data flow: [How data moves through the app]
- State updates: [How state changes]
- Side effects: [Where async operations happen]

### Similar Existing Features:
- **Feature: [Name]** - Located at `src/features/[path]/`
  - Does: [What it does]
  - Pattern: [What pattern it uses]
  - Could copy: [What could be reused]
