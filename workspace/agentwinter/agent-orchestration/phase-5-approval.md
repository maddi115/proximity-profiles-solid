# Phase 5: Approval

## ⚠️ PHASE 5: APPROVAL (MANDATORY - FINAL STEP)

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST complete this phase with confidence assessment and questions. This is the FINAL step before awaiting user approval.**

**FINALLY, YOU MUST OUTPUT THIS EXACT TEXT:**
```

PHASE 5: APPROVAL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Plan Summary:

**What this achieves:**
- [Primary goal in user's language]
- [Secondary benefits]

**How it integrates:**
- Follows [specific pattern] from [existing feature]
- Uses [architectural approach] consistent with codebase
- Connects to [existing systems] at [integration points]

**Why this approach:**
- [Reason 1: aligns with existing patterns]
- [Reason 2: minimal risk]
- [Reason 3: maintainable]

**Trade-offs:**
- **Accepting:** [What we're giving up]
- **Because:** [Why it's worth it]

### ⚠️ MANDATORY Confidence Assessment:

**High confidence (90%+):**
- [Aspects I'm very certain about]
- [Patterns that are well-established]

**Medium confidence (70-90%):**
- [Aspects with some uncertainty]
- [Areas that might need adjustment]

**Lower confidence (<70%):**
- [Areas where I'm making assumptions]
- [Things that might need clarification]

### ⚠️ MANDATORY Questions for you:

Before I proceed, please clarify if needed:

1. [Question about unclear requirement, if any]
2. [Question about preference between two options, if any]
3. [Question about scope or priority, if any]

*(If no questions, state: "No clarifications needed - requirements are clear.")*

### Final Check:

**If approved, I will:**
- Create X new files (~Y lines total)
- Modify Z existing files (~W lines total)
- Follow [specific pattern] from codebase
- Estimated time: [Small/Medium/Large]

### Approval Required:

**Do you approve this plan?**

Please respond with:
- **"yes"** / **"approved"** / **"go ahead"** → I'll implement it
- **"revise [aspect]"** → I'll adjust the plan
- **"explain [aspect]"** → I'll clarify that part
- **"alternative"** → I'll present a different approach

---

**CRITICAL RULE:**
Do NOT provide any code implementation until the user explicitly approves with words like "yes", "approved", "go ahead", or "implement".

If the user asks for changes or has questions, revise the plan and go through phases 2-5 again with the adjusted approach.
