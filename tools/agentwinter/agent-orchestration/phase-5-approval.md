# Phase 5: Approval

## PHASE 5: APPROVAL

**FINALLY, YOU MUST OUTPUT THIS EXACT TEXT:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 5: APPROVAL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Do you approve this plan?
```

After the approval question, provide a brief summary explaining:
- How this plan integrates with existing architecture
- What patterns it follows from the codebase
- Why this approach is optimal
- Any trade-offs or considerations

**CRITICAL RULE:** 
Do NOT provide any code implementation until the user explicitly says:
- "yes"
- "approved"
- "approve"
- "go ahead"

If the user asks for changes, revise the plan and go through phases 2-5 again.
